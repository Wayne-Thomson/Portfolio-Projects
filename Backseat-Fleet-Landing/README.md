#Backseat Fleet Landing Page

The whole Backseat Fleet website is build using the Mongose Express React Node (MERN) stack, but for the landing page it was built with just React and X.

The contact form sends messages to a Node backend, but is disabled for the landing page.

The complete project interacts with the DVLAs Car checking API using axios and the frontend sends API calls to the Node.js backend also using axios. The backend
a MongoDB cloud server for data storage. 

Upon request I can demo the clientside operation of the full website, but at the moment the source code is not available to release.

Can be viewed live at ENTER URL
