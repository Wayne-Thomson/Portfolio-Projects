This is a simple database built in Java. 

It stores Employees in a Company.

Within the code I have used many different Java principles:

Encapsulation
Inheritence
Polymorphism
Overloading
Interfaces
Much, much more

I built the UI with JavaFX it is fairly simple, but I think for a simple database
it is reasonable.

The project source can be found in "Development" and an executable version found in "Compiled and Exe"

Feel free to use this code for anything!
