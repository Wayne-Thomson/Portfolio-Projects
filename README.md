# Portfolio-Projects
Here are my portfolio projects

A simple breakdown:

1. Favourite Anime List
Create a list of your favourite anime and then generate a sharecode that others can use to view your list. Consumes MyAnimeList.com API. Completely a frontend application that runs stateless.

2. E-Commerce
A full stack e-commerce website with a simple admin panel and a store front with working checkout system and user accounts.

3. Notflix - Netflix clone
A little bit of a cookie cutter project, but with some added fuctionality such as pulling data from imdb.com and myanimelist.com when adding new content, consumes thier APIs, and some backend work to make a functional login system with mongoBD and API interaction with a node server. The main goal of this application was for personal use to easily store and for easy access by family and friends.

4. Backseat Fleet - Landing Page
This is the front end landing page or a personal project I am working on. At this moment in time I have not shared the code for the backend 
nor the content past the login screen. The full application uses a Node.js server for the backend, accesses the DVLA car API and pulls licence data from the DVLA.

5. Job Hunting Game
A little sidescrolling game that I had the idea to build. The art is... questionable, but, for the most part, made by myself.

6. Algorithms
Some little visaul displays of various sorting and path finding algorithms. Mostly made or fun and to get better with some of them.
